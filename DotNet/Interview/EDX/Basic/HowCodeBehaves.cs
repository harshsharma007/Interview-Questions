            01. Your application executes on the target computing platform through the use of the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

            02. This also means that C# is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled language.

            03. The common language runtime is the foundation of the .Net Framework.

            04. The runtime is responsible for managing your code at execution time.

            05. It provides core services such as memory management, thread management and remoting.

            06. The CLR enforces strict type safety and provides security and robustness for managed applications.

            07. The class library is a comprehensive collection of reusable types .Net classes that you will use to develop applications ranging from traditional
                command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) applications to applications based on the latest innovations provided by ASP.NET and Microsoft Azure services.

            08. The .NET Framework and C# are extensible and also allow you to easily create your own custom classes and libraries of managed objects for code reuse.

            09. Code that targets the runtime is known as managed code, while code that does not target the runtime is known as unmanaged code.

            10. The .NET Framework can be hosted by unmanaged components that load the common language runtime into their processes and initiate the execution of managed
                code, thereby creating a software environment that can exploit both managed and unmanaged features.

            11. The .NET Framework not only provides several runtime hosts, but also supports the development of third-party runtime hosts.

            12. For example, ASP.NET hosts the runtime to provide a scalable, server-side environment for managed code.

            13. ASP.NET works directly with the runtime to enable ASP.NET applications and XML Web services, both of which are discussed later in this topic.

            14. All of these components coexist and interact to provide a platform to your C# application.
