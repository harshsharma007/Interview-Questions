            Introducing Object-Oriented Programming in C#
            Classes enable you to create your own custom, self-contained and reusable types. Interfaces enable you to define a set of inputs and outputs that classes
            must implement in order to ensure compatibility with consumers of the classes. In this module, you will learn how to use interfaces and classes to define
            and create your own custom, reusable types.
            
            Objectives
            After completing this module, you will be able to:
            - Create and instantiate classes.
            - Create and implement interfaces.
