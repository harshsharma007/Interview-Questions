            The open/closed principle says "A software module/class is open for extension and closed for modification".
            Here "Open for extension" means, we need to design our module/class in such a way that the new functionality can be added only when new requirements
            are generated. "Closed for modification" means we have already developed a class and it has gone through unit testing. We should then not alter it until we 
            find bugs. As it says, a class should be open for extensions, we can use inheritance to do this.
