            The .NET Framework includes various built-in data types, such as int, decimal, string and Boolean. These data types can be identified as simple data types
            because they consist of a single, simple value such as a number, text value, or a true or false setting. You could argue that String is not a simple data
            type, and to a certain extent, that is correct. C/C++ and other similar languages consider a String to be a character array. Because this module will
            cover arrays, we could agree with that and we do. The key difference for C# is that we can use a String value as a simple data structure without worrying
            about accessing it as a character array, dealing with a pointer to the start of the array, or any other string functions found in C. We could, because
            C# is flexible enough to allow it, but for the purpose of data types in C#, consider the String to be a simple data type.
            
            The complex data types are suited for scenarios where you need to store multiple items in a single entity. Consider a deck of cards, the days of the week,
            months of the year, and even more complex items such as an object in code to represent a car. Each of these examples requires multiple values to reflect
            the concept. We think of a week as a single entity that consists of seven days. When we talk about a week, we do so with the inherent knowledge of what a
            week consists of.
