            An array is a set of objects that are grouped together and managed as a unit. You can think of an array as a sequence of elements, all of which are the same
            type. You can build simple arrays that have one dimension (a list), two dimensions (a table), three dimensions (a cube), and so on. Arrays in Visual C#
            have the following features:
                1. Every element in the array contains a value.
                2. Arrays are zero-indexed, that is, the first item in the array is element 0.
                3. The size of an array is the total number of elements that it can contain.
                4. Arrays can be single-dimensional, multidimensional, or jagged.
                5. The rank of an array is the number of dimensions in the array.
            
            Arrays of a particular type can only hold elements of that type. If you need to manipulate a set of unlike objects or value types, consider using one of
            the collection types that are defined in the System.Collections namespace.
