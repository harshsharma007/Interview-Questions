            SRP says "Every software module should have only one reason to change."
            
            This means that every class, or similar structure, in your code should have only one job to do. Everything in that class should be related to a single 
            purpose. Our class should not be like a Swiss knife wherein if one of them needs to be changed then the entire tool needs to be altered. It does not mean 
            that your classes should only contain one method or property. There may be many members as long as they relate to the single responsibility.
