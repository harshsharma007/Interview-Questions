            Yes, if you create an object array. Since all types inherit (directly or indirectly) from object type, we can add any type to the object array, including
            complex types like Customer, Employee etc. You need to override the ToString() method if you want meaningful output when ToString() method is invoked.

                If you want to store different data types within an array create an array of type object. Then we can store string, int together in an object array.
                Because object type is the base type for all types in dotnet, every type within dotnet directly or indirectly inherit from object type. So we can add
                any type of object to this array including complex types.
