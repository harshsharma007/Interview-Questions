            In C#, a statement is considered a command. Statements perform some action in your code such as calling a method or performing calculations. Statements
            are also used to declare variables and assign values to them.
            
            Statements are formed from tokens. These tokens can be keywords, identifiers (variables), operators and the statement terminator which is the semicolon (;).
            All statements in C# must be terminated with a semicolon.
