            You call a method to run the code in that method from part of your application. You do not need to understand how the code in a method works. You may not even have access 
            to the code, if it is in a class in an assembly for which you do not have the source, such as the .NET Framework class library.
            
            To call a method, you specify the method name and provide any arguments that correspond to the method parameters in brackets. The following code example shows how to invoke
            the StartService method, passing int and Boolean variables to satisfy the parameter requirements of the method's signature.
            
            var upTime = 2000;
            var shutdownAutomatically = true;
            StartService(upTime, shutdownAutomatically);
            
            // Start Service
            void StartService(int upTime, bool shutdownAutomatically)
            {
                // Perform some processing here.
            }
        */
    }
