            Encapsulation
            Often considered the first pillar of object-oriented programming, encapsulation can be used to describe the accessibility of the members belonging to a
            class or struct. C# provides access modifiers and properties to help implement encapsulation in your classes. While some consider this accessibility
            configuration to be the only aspect of encapsulation, others also define encapsulation as the act of including all data and behavior required of the class,
            within the class definition. This definition can be stretched a bit in C# when using partial classes. Review the topic on classes to see what partial
            classes are all about.

            Encapsulation can have a couple of meanings depending on how you look at it. It could be simply meaning that all we're going to ensure we encapsulate
            or include all of our behaviors and attributes of our class in one structure or it could also simply mean that through encapsulation we are going to perform
            what's known as "data hiding".
