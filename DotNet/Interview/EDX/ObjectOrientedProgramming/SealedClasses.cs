            Sealed Classes
            We have covered inheritance for class heirarchies and have shown how base classes can be inherited by sub classes and we have discussed abstract classes.
            Both concepts focus on the ability of a class to be inherited and provide attributes and behaviors to other classes, for the purpose of code reuse.
            But what happens if you decide that you don't want your class to be inherited? How do you prevent that from happening? Quite simply, you can create a
            sealed class. You can use the sealed keyword on your class restrict the inheritance feature of object oriented programming. If a class is derived from a
            sealed class then the compiler throws an error.
            
            Although we didn't cover this in the topic on structs, it is important to note that while structs are like classes in some aspects, structs are sealed.
            Therefore you cannot derive a class from a struct.
