            Introducing LINQ
            Language Integrated Query (LINQ) defines a range of standard query operators that enable you to retrieve exactly the data that you require in a declarative way. LINQ
            also supports compile-time syntax-checking and type-checking and also uses Microsoft Intellisense in Visual Studio.
            
            You can use LINQ to query data from a wide range of data sources, including .NET Framework collections, Microsoft SQL Server databases, ADO.NET data sets, and XML
            documents. In fact, you can use it to query any data source that implements the IEnumerable interface.
            
            The syntax of all LINQ queries has the same basis, as follows:
            from <variable names> in <data source>
            select <variable names>
            
            However, you can customize this syntax in many ways to retrieve exactly the data that you require in the format that you want. In this module, you will learn how to query
            data and use anonymous methods and how to force query execution to override the default deferred query execution behavior.
