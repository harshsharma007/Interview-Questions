            Static Vs Singleton
            - Static is a keyword and Singleton is a design pattern.
            - The fundamental difference is, Singleton gives you an object whereas static classes just provide static methods.
            - Static classes can contain only static members.
            - Singleton is an object creational pattern with one instance of the class.
            - Singleton can implement interfaces, inherit from other classes and it aligns with the OOPS concepts.
            - Singleton object can be passed as a reference.
            - Singleton supports object disposal.
            - Singleton object is stored on heap whereas static classes are stored on stacks.
            - Singleton objects can be cloned.
