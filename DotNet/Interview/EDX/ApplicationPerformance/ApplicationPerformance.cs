            Application Performance
            Modern processors use threads to concurrently run multiple operations. If your application performs all of its logic on a single thread, you do not make the best use of the
            available processing resources, which can result in a poor experience for your users. In this module, you will learn how to improve the performance of your applications
            by distributing your operations across multiple threads.
            
            At the same time, applications will sometimes rely on long running processes either locally or on a server over a network connection. Application performance can also be
            seen through the eyes of a user in terms of responsiveness. Through the use of asynchronous operations, you can create a responsive user interface that allows the user
            to continue interaction with the application while long running processes execute in the background and then return a notification when the operation is complete.
