            What is Singleton Design Pattern?
            The singleton pattern is one of the best-known patterns in software engineering. Essentially, a singleton is a class which only allows a single instance of
            itself to be created, and usually gives simple access to that instance. Most commonly, singletons don't allow parameters to be specified when creating the
            instance - as otherwise a second request for an instance but with a different parameter could be problematic! (If the same instance should be accessed for
            all requests with the same parameter, the factory pattern is more appropriate.) This article deals only with the situation where no parameters are required.
            Typically, a requirement of singletons is that they are created lazily i.e. that the instance isn't created until it is first needed.

            There are various ways to implement Singleton Pattern in C#. I shall present them here in reverse order of elegance, starting with the most commonly seen,
            which is not thread safe, and working up to a fully lazily-loaded, thread-safe, simple and highly performant version.

            All these implementations share four common characteristics, however:

            1. A single constructor that is private and parameterless. This prevents other classes from instantiating it (which would be a violation of the pattern).
            Note that it also prevents subclassing - if a singleton can be subclassed once, it can be subclassed twice, and if each of those subclasses can create an
            instance, the pattern is violated. The factory pattern can be used if you need a single instance of a base type, but the exact type isn't known until runtime.
            2. The class is sealed. This is unnecessary, strictly speaking, due to the above point, but may help the JIT to optimize things more.
            3. A static variable which holds a reference to the single created instance, if any.
            4. A public static means of getting the reference to the single created instance, creating one if necessary.

            Note that all of these implementations also use a public static property Instance as the means of accessing the instance. In all cases, the property could
            easily be converted to a method, with no impact on thread-safety or performance.

            Advantages of Singleton Pattern are:

            Disadvantages of Singleton Pattern are:

            How to implement Singleton Pattern in your code. (There are many ways to implement a Singleton Pattern in C#)
            1. No Thread Safe Singleton.
            2. Thread-Safety Singleton.
            3. Thread-Safety Singleton using Double-Check Locking.
            4. Thread-Safety Singleton without using locks and no lazy instantiation.
            5. Full Lazy instantiation.
            6. Using .Net 4's Lazy<T> type.

            1. No Thread Safe Singleton

            As stated before, the following code is not thread-safe. Two different threads could both have evaluated the test (if instance == null) and found it to be
            true, the both creates instances, which violates the singleton pattern. Note that in fact the instance may already have been created before the expression is
            evaluated, but the memory model doesn't guarantee that the new value of instance will be seen by other threads unless suitable memory barriers have been 
            passed.

            2. Thread Safety Singleton

            1. This implementation is thread-safe. The thread takes out a lock on a shared object, and then checks whether or not the instance has been created before
            creating the instance. This takes care of the memory barrier issue (as locking makes sure that all reads occur logically after the lock acquire, and 
            unlocking makes sure that all writes occur logically before the lock release) and ensures that only one thread will create an instance (as only one thread 
            can be in that part of the code at a time - by the time the second thread enters it, the first thread will have created the instance, so the expression will 
            evaluate to false). Unfortunately, performance suffers as a lock is acquired every time the instance is requested.

            2. Note that instead of locking on typeof(Singleton) as some versions of this implementation do, I lock on the value of a static variable which is private to
            the class. Locking on objects which other classes can access and lock on (such as the type) risks performance issues and even deadlocks. This is a general
            style preference of mine - wherever possible, only lock on objects specifically created for the purpose of locking, or which document that they are to be
            locked on for specific purposes (e.g. for waiting/pulsing a queue). Usually such objects should be private to the class they are used in. This helps to make
            writing thread-safe applications significantly easier.

            3. Thread Safety Singleton using Double Check Locking

            This implementation attempts to be thread-safe without the necessity of taking out a lock every time. Unfortunately, there are four downsides to the pattern:
            1. It doesn't work in Java. This may seem an odd thing to comment on, but it's worth knowing if you ever need the singleton pattern in Java and C#
            programmers may well also be Java programmers. The Java memory model doesn't ensure that the constructor completes before the reference to the new object
            is assigned to instance. The Java memory model underwent a reworking for version 1.5, but double-check lock is still broken after this without a volatile
            variable (as in C#).
            2. Without any memory barriers, it's broken in the ECMA CLI specification too. It's possible that under the .Net 2.0 memory model (which is stronger than the
            ECMA spec) it's safe, but I'd rather not rely on those stronger semantics, especially if there's any doubt as to the safety. Making the instance variable
            volatile can make it work, as would explicit memory barrier calls, although in the latter case even experts can't agree exactly which barriers are required.
            I tend to try to avoid situations where experts don't agree what's right and what's wrong!
            3. It's easy to get wrong. The pattern needs to be pretty much exactly as above - any significant changes are likely to impact either performance or
            correctness.
            4. It still doesn't perform as well as the later implementations.

            4. Thread Safe Singleton without using locks and no lazy instantiation

            As you can see, this is extremely simple - but why is it thread-safe and how lazy is it? Well, static constructors in C# are specified to execute only when 
            an instance of the class is created or a static member is referenced and to execute only once per AppDomain. Given that this check for the type being newly
            constructed needs to be executed whatever else happens, it will be faster than adding extra checking as in the previous examples. There are couple of 
            wrinkles, however:
            1. It's not as lazy as the other implementations. In particular, if you have static members other than Instance, the first reference to those members will
            involve creating the instance. This is corrected in the next implementation.
            2. There are complications if one static constructor invokes another which invokes the first again. Look in the .Net specifications (currently section 9.5.3
            of partition II) for more details about the exact nature of type initializers - they're unlikely to bite you, but it's worth being aware of the consequences
            of static constructors which refer to each other in a cycle.
            3. The laziness of type initializers is only guaranteed by .Net when the type isn't marked with a special flag called beforefieldinit. Unfortunately, the C#
            compiler (as provided in the .Net 1.1 runtime, at least) marks all types which don't have a static constructor (i.e. a block which looks like a constructor
            but is marked static) as beforefieldinit. Also note, that it affects performance, as discussed near the bottom of the page.

            One shortcut you can take with this implementation (and only this one) is to just make instance a public static readonly variable and get rid of the property
            entirely. This makes the basic skeleton code absolutely tiny! Many people, however, prefer to have a property in case further action is needed in future, and
            JIT inlining is likely to make the performance identical. (Note that the static constructor itself is still required if you require laziness).

            Performance vs Laziness
            In many cases, you won't actually require full laziness - unless your class initialization does something particularly time-consuming or has some side-effect
            elsewhere, it's probably fine to leave out the explicit static constructor shown above. This can increase performance as it allows the JIT compiler to make a
            single check (for instance at the start of a method) to ensure that the type has been initialized and then assume it from then on. If your singleton instance
            is referenced within a relatively tight loop, this can make a (relatively) significant performance difference. You should decide whether or not fully lazy
            instantiation is required and document this decision appropriately within the class.

            A lot of reason for this page's existence is people trying to be clever and thus coming up with the double-checked locked algorithm. There is an attitude of
            locking being expensive which is common and misguided. I've written a very quick benchmark which just acquires singleton instances in a loop a billion ways,
            trying different variants. It's not terribly scientific, because in real life you may want to know how fast it is if each iteration actually involved a call
            into a method fetching the singleton, etc. However, it does show an important point. On my laptop, the slowest solution (by a factor of about 5) is the 
            locking one (solution 2). Is that important? Probably not, when you bear in mind that it still managed to acquire the singleton a billion times in under 
            40 seconds.
            
            (Note: this article was originally written quite a while ago now - I'd expect better performance now). That means that if you're "only" acquiring the 
            singleton four hundred thousand times per second, the cost of the acquisition is going to be 1% of the performance - so improving it isn't going to do a 
            lot. Now, if you are acquiring the singleton that often - isn't it likely you're using it within a loop? If you care that much about improving the 
            performance a little bit, why not declare a local variable outside the loop, acquire the singleton once and then loop. Bingo, event the slowest 
            implementation becomes easily adequate.

            I would be very interested to see a real world application where the difference between using simple locking and using one of the faster solutions actually
            made a significant performance difference.

            Exceptions
            Sometimes, you need to do work in a singleton constructor which may throw an exception, but might not be fatal to the whole application. Potentially, your
            application may be able to fix the problem and want to try again. Using type initializers to construct the singleton becomes problematic at this stage.
            Different runtimes handle this case differently, but I don't know of any which do the desired thing (running the type initializer again), and even if one 
            did, your code would be broken on other runtimes. To avoid these problems, I'd suggest using the second pattern listed on the page - just use a simple lock, 
            and go through the check each time, building the instance in the method/property if it hasn't already been successfully built.

            Conclusion
            There are various different ways of implementing the singleton pattern in C#. A reader has written to me detailing a way he has encapsulated the 
            synchronization aspect, which while I acknowledge may be useful in a few particular situations (specifically where you want very high performance and the 
            ability to determine whether or not the singleton has been created and full laziness regardless of other static members being called). I don't personally 
            see that situation coming up often enough to merit going further with on this page.

            My personal preference is for solution 4: the only time I would normally go away from it is if I needed to be able to call other static methods without
            triggering initialization or if I needed to know whether or not the singleton has already been instantiated. I don't remember the last time I was in that
            situation, assuming I even have. In that case, I'd probably go for solution 2, which is still nice and easy to get right.

            Solution 5 is elegant, but trickier than 2 or 4, and as I said above, the benefits it provides seem to only be rarely useful. Solutio 6 is a simpler way to
            achieve laziness, if you're using .Net 4. It also has the advantage that it's obviously lazy. I currently tend to still use solution 4, simply through habit -
            but if I were working with inexperienced developers I'd quite possibly go for solution 6 to start with as an easy and universally applicable pattern.

            I wouldn't use solution 1 because it's broken and I wouldn't use solution 3 because it has no benefits over 5.
