            /*
                C# semaphore allows only a limited number of threads to enter into a critical section. Semaphore is mainly used in scenarios where we have limited number
                of resources and we have to limit the number of threads that can use it.
            
                How Semaphore Works
                Semaphores are Int32 variables stored in an operating system resources. When we initialize the semaphore object we initialize with number. This number 
                limits the threads that can enter into the critical section.
            
                When a thread enters into a critical section, it decreases the Int32 variable with 1 and when a thread exits from a critical section, it increases the
                Int32 variable with 1.
            
                When the Int32 variable is 0, no thread can enters into a critical section. Below is the syntax of C# semaphore initialization.
            */

            Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(initialCount: 0, maximumCount: 5);

            /*
                We initialize semaphore object with two parameters:
                1. InitialCount
                2. MaximumCount
                
                Maximum count defines how many maximum threads can enter into a critical section. InitialCount set the value of Int32 variable. For example, if we set
                the maximum count of 3 and initial count of 0. That means 3 threads are already in the critical section. If we set the maximum count of 3 and initial
                count of 3, that means maximum 3 threads can enter into a critical section and there is no threads currently in the critical section.

            /*
                Used semaphore between multiple processes
                Alternatively, semaphore has another constructor which takes additional string as parameter. This string parameter is a unique string which is used for
                using semaphore between multiple process.
                
                Below is the syntax of creating semaphore.

                Threads can enter into the critical section by using WaitOne method. They called the WaitOne method on semaphore object. If the Int32 variable
                maintained by semaphore is greater than 0 then it allows calling thread to enter.
