            Using enums has several advantages over using text or numerical types:
            -Improved manageability. By constraining a variable to a fixed set of valid values, you are less likely to experience invalid arguments and spelling mistakes.
            -Improved developer experience. In Visual Studio, the Intellisense feature will prompt you with the available values when you use an enum.
            -Improved code readability. The enum syntax makes your code easier to read and understand.
            
            Each member of an enum has a name and a value. The name is the string you define in the braces, such as Sunday or Monday. By default, the value is an integer.
            If you do not specify a value for each member, the members are assigned incremental values starting with 0. For example, Day.Sunday is equal to 0 and
            Day.Monday is equal to 1.
            
            The following example shows how you can use names and values interchangeably:
            
            Using Enum Names and Values Interchangeably
            
            // Set an enum variable by name.
            Day favoriteDay = Day.Friday;
            // Set an enum variable by value.
            Day favoriteDay = (Day)4;

    }
